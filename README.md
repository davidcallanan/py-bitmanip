# Tiny Python Bit Manipulation Library

An old Python module I created back in the days that I used to use Python.

Offers an easy way to manipulate bits.

Simply copy and paste the `bitmanip.py` file into your project!

## Usage

```
import bitmanip
# In this module, 0 is considered the least-significant bit

# The functions available are fairly self-explanatory:
# bitmask = bitmanip.bitmask(start, end?)
# result  = bitmanip.getbits(x, bitmask)
# result  = bitmanip.setbits(x, mask, y)
```
